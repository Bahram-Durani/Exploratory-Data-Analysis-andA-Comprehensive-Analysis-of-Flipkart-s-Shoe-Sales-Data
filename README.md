# A-Comprehensive-Analysis-of-Flipkart-s-Shoe-Sales-Data

## Shoe Data Extraction and Analysis Project

### Overview

* In this project, our primary objective is to extract shoes data from the Flipkart website. We have utilized Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape data for both male and female shoes. The extracted data includes various attributes such as brand, final price, gender, and other relevant information.

### Data Extraction

* We employed Selenium, a powerful automation tool, along with BeautifulSoup, a Python library for web scraping, to collect comprehensive data on shoes available on Flipkart. By navigating through the website dynamically, we were able to retrieve a diverse set of shoe listings.

### Data Analysis

* The extracted shoe data serves as the foundation for our analysis. We aim to discern patterns, trends, and insights within the shoe market based on different attributes. Our analysis includes segmentation by brand, pricing trends, gender preferences, and more.

### Visualizations

* To enhance the interpretability of our findings, we've incorporated visualizations using Matplotlib within Jupyter Notebook. These visualizations provide a graphical representation of our analysis, aiding in the identification of significant trends and patterns.

### Power BI Integration

* In addition to Matplotlib visualizations, we have also uploaded a Power BI file for more advanced and interactive visualizations. Power BI enables deeper exploration and analysis of the shoe data, offering users a dynamic and intuitive interface for data interpretation.
